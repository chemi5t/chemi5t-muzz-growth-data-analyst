-- Summary of Part 1: Verification Analysis

-- - Failure Counts: This section shows the number of failed verifications (verified = 0) for each group (SMS/WhatsApp) and method. It also calculates the percentage of failures relative to total entries.
-- - Success Counts: This part counts successful verifications (verified = 1) and computes the percentage of successes.
-- - Method Selection Counts: This calculates how often each method (SMS/WhatsApp) was selected by users and its relative percentage.
-- - Verification Success Rate by Method: The average success rate of verification for each method (SMS/WhatsApp).
-- - Verification Success Rate by Group: The overall success rate for each group (SMS/WhatsApp) and the groupâ€™s representation in the data.

-- Summary of Part 2: Cost Analysis

-- - Cost Analysis: This section calculates the total cost per country and method (SMS/WhatsApp) based on the user count and cost per method. It also calculates the verification success rate for each country and method.
-- - Total Entries Percent: The percentage of total entries for each country and method is computed relative to all entries.

-- Overall Findings

-- - Verification Performance: You can see the distribution of failure and success rates across different verification methods (SMS/WhatsApp) and groups. This helps in understanding which method performs better and where improvements might be needed.
-- - Cost Efficiency: The analysis highlights the total costs incurred for each method and country. It also compares the verification success rate, helping assess the cost-effectiveness of each method.
-- - Country and Method Trends: The data shows how often each method is used in different countries and its correlation with verification success rates and costs, providing insights into regional preferences and their impact on verification efficiency.
-- - This analysis can guide decisions on optimizing verification methods and managing costs based on performance and regional trends.
