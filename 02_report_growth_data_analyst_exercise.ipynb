    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This `analysis` focused on evaluating verification success rates `across three test groups` using `SMS` and `WhatsApp` as verification `methods`. `Group A (SMS-only)` demonstrated the lowest success rate (0.8735), while `Groups B (SMS > WhatsApp)`and `C (WhatsApp > SMS)`, which offered both methods, achieved higher rates, suggesting that providing users with multiple verification options enhances success. Group C had the highest overall success rate at 0.9282, with SMS achieving the highest individual success rate within this group (0.9535).\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings show that SMS generally `outperforms` WhatsApp in verification success, particularly when offered as a secondary option. User preference tends to align with the first method offered, as shown by the higher WhatsApp uptake in Group C and higher SMS uptake in Group B. `A key insight `is that a two-method setup increases the likelihood of successful verification compared to a single-method approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further analysis could integrate cost data by region, user demographics, and connectivity to optimise method selection for different user segments. Overall, incorporating a dual-method approach while prioritising SMS where feasible appears to be a reliable strategy for improving verification success.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on Data Integrity:** Some rows were removed due to either null values or a lack of reference in another table. This data cleanup process is detailed in the `00_data_cleanup_and_starschema_constraints.sql` file, ensuring more accurate analysis by excluding incomplete data points.\n",

    "    - SMS has a 0.9298 success rate, representing 88.76% of group interactions. WhatsApp has a slightly lower success rate of 0.9144, representing 11.24% of the group.\n",
    "- **Group C (WhatsApp > SMS):** \n",
    "    - `WhatsApp` is used more `frequently` (63.83%) but has a `lower success rate` (0.9140). `SMS`, though less used (36.17%), has the `highest success rate across all methods` at 0.9535.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dual-Method Effectiveness:** \n",
    "    - Groups B and C, both of which offer SMS and WhatsApp, show higher success rates than Group A, suggesting that `providing a choice` of methods may increase verification success.\n",
    "- **Higher Success with SMS:** \n",
    "    - Within Groups B and C, SMS `consistently outperforms` WhatsApp, especially in Group C, where SMS achieves a 0.9535 success rate, indicating it may be a `more reliable option` in some cases.\n",
    "- **First Method Preference:** \n",
    "    - In groups with two methods, the `first method is often preferred`: Group C (WhatsApp > SMS) favors WhatsApp at 63.83%, while Group B (SMS > WhatsApp) heavily favors SMS at 88.74%. Group C’s lower performance when WhatsApp is prioritised suggests that SMS could be a better first choice.\n",

    "- **Additional Data:** \n",
    "    - Including data on method costs and regional distribution would offer valuable insights into the cost-effectiveness and performance of verification methods. This would enable refined recommendations on method allocation based on geographic differences and regional preferences.\n"

    "**Explanation of Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The query is designed to calculate the total cost of each verification method (SMS and WhatsApp) per country, based on the number of users and the unit costs (`whatsapp_usd` and `sms_usd`). It also computes the verification success rate for each method by country. This allows for a cost-performance evaluation, which could influence decision-making on which verification method to prioritize in each region.\n",

    "\n",
    "**4. Why do you think your chosen screen performed best?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The chosen screen, which offers both WhatsApp and SMS verification options (Group C: WhatsApp > SMS), performed best due to a few key factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increased Flexibility**: Offering two methods gives users the flexibility to select their preferred verification method, which may boost comfort and ease of use, enhancing success rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher Success Rates with SMS as a Secondary Option**: While WhatsApp was the primary option in this group, SMS verification proved to have the highest individual success rate across all groups (0.9535). This suggests that users are more likely to succeed when SMS is available as a fallback option, especially for those who may face connectivity issues or limitations with WhatsApp.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Preference Alignment**: Data suggests that when presented with multiple options, users tend to select the first method offered, as shown by the higher WhatsApp uptake in Group C. This initial engagement likely contributes to the group’s high overall success rate (0.9282).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the dual-method setup, paired with prioritising WhatsApp but retaining SMS as a secondary option, likely optimises both user satisfaction and verification success.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Would you recommend any additional changes to the screen?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I would recommend the following adjustments to further enhance the screen's effectiveness based on observed success rates and user preferences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Highlight SMS as a Recommended Option**: Given that SMS generally has a higher individual success rate, especially as a secondary choice (0.9535 in Group C), `subtly recommending it` could improve overall verification rates. This can be achieved without overwhelming users by framing SMS as a reliable fallback option.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implement a Hybrid Model**: Allow `users to select their preferred` primary method, with an option to switch if the initial method fails. This flexibility may improve verification success, particularly for users in regions with connectivity challenges that impact WhatsApp or SMS availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contextual Guidance**: SMS could be recommended in regions with low internet connectivity, guiding users toward the method most likely to succeed in their situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regular Evaluation and Adjustment**: Conduct `periodic evaluations` of verification success rates by region and adjust the method allocation `based on regional performance`, user preference, and cost efficiency. This could involve making SMS the default method in areas where it outperforms WhatsApp and prioritising WhatsApp in regions where it is more successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incorporate User Feedback Mechanisms**: Including a `feedback option` for users who experience issues with their chosen method can help refine the system for future users. Analysing this feedback would also allow for further personalisation and `regional adjustments` in verification processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary of Findings and Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis supports the effectiveness of a two-method setup, particularly when SMS is prioritised or recommended as a fallback. The recommendations aim to enhance the user experience while maximising verification success across diverse user segments. Future improvements should integrate regional performance, user preference, and cost data to ensure the verification process remains efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly.\n"
